# RuneQuest Glorantha (Unofficial) system for Foundry Virtual Table Top

## Usage

Purely private use...

## Development

After a `yarn install` to get the dependencies, do `yarn build` that will build the system into a `dist` folder. For easy development make a softlink from `foundrydata/Data/systems/rqg` to that `dist` folder.
If you want to have hotload on save you can do `yarn build:watch`. 

If you like to remove the system from foundry then remove the file system softlink.

## Project Status

Still very much work in progress. ðŸš§
