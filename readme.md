# RuneQuest Glorantha (Unofficial) system for Foundry Virtual Table Top

## Usage
Because RuneQuest Glorantha (Unofficial) doesn't have an SRD or anything other than the quick start the system lacks compendiums. GMs will need to create all of the skills, spells and other items they want to use for character creation.

## Project Status
Still very much work in progress. ðŸš§
