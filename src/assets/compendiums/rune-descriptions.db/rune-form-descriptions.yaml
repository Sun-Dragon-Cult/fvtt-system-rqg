  This Rune is also called the Dragon’s Eye, and is supposed to represent the armor plate over
  the eye of a dragon. Dragons are thought to be the progenitors of all beasts (at least those
  with four or more legs) though no one has had the nerve to ask a dragon about it. It is
  thought to have originally been a Dragonewt Rune, and its complexity would indicate this.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Beast Rune is to be bestial, savage, feral, wild, and untamed. Such adventurers are uncomfortable
  in cultivated lands, preferring the wilderness.</p>

  Descriptive of beings tainted by Chaos. The Chaos Rune might be combined with any other
  Rune, as nothing is totally safe from its influence.</p>

  The symbol of the first life upon Glorantha. It is said to symbolize the first Plant god, a son of
  the Earth and Sea. Many cults have a connection with the Plant Rune, such as Aldrya, whose
  worship combines the Runes of Earth, Plant, and the Power Rune of Fertility.</p>

  As exotic as the race it represents, it is found only in the Dragon Pass area. Unlike most of
  the other Form Runes, it is never used with an Elemental Rune.</p>

  This Rune represents the humanoid shape and is common among all humanoid races. Some
  other races interpret it as “slave” or “food.” It is said to represent Grandfather Mortal, and
  numerous folktales are told about him.</p>
