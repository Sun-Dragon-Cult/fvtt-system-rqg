  This all-purpose Rune can symbolize the mastery of mortals, of magic, or of elements. As
  the mastery of mortals, it describes a Hero; as the mastery of magic, it symbolizes any cult of
  reasonable power. The use of such Condition Runes usually masks the true identifying Runes of
  the cult or person described, although it may also signify the independence of a Hero or powerful
  magician from cult ties.</p>

  Almost redundant in this magic-rich world, this Rune describes how a cult or individual deals
  with the power of another Rune. Since it is impossible to deal with Runes without magic, this
  Rune is especially important.</p>

  The mark of the gods. One who possesses the Infinity Rune is almost like a god. This Rune is
  not used lightly, as it implies total control of the power flow around the user, making them
  invulnerable to almost all magic. It is characteristic of gods, dragons, and the greatest Heroes only.</p>

  Thought to be both an expression of Chaos as well as the stamp of approval of the gods, this
  Rune is little used, except in the Holy Country, where the Masters of Luck and Death proudly
  display the symbol of the chance they take with every breath.</p>

  Very few cults use this as an expression of the way of the world. Instead, it is used by
  downtrodden cultures that have no other explanation for their status, and conversely by those at
  the top, to justify their own positions.</p>
