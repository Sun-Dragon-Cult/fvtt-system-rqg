  <p><em><strong>Mostali lithanthropus</strong></em></p>
  <p>Also called dwarfs, the Mostali claim descent from Mostal the Maker, a primeval deity said to have created the World. The dwarfs have
  a long and ancient history, most of which is unknown to humanity. They are pragmatic and stoic, happy with practical matters and unafraid
  of hard work, and are conservative and secretive to an extreme. Their hard religion offers them personal immortality. The official
  dwarf religion</p>

  <p>is a sorcery of a limited, but practical, variety.</p>

  <p>The Mostali are locked in eternal war with the elves (dating from the early Gods War) and are no friends to trolls. The enmity of
  elf and dwarf predates the current form of both species and reaches back to their creation. The byword of their relationships with other
  intelligent beings is always mutual distrust.</p>

  <p>The dwarfs are divided into occupational castes that often behave like separate species. Only the soldier caste—the Iron Dwarfs—is
  regularly seen outside their underground cities. The iron discipline and unyielding attitude of dwarf culture is inhuman in its rigidity.
  Most humans cannot understand their machine-like state of mind. Apparently, many dwarfs cannot either, for there is a significant rate
  of desertion from the ranks. These are considered heretics by conventional dwarfs, and in some places, they form whole societies.</p>

  <p>The Mostali were the first to discover iron and were the first to learn to work it. They have created many other constructs to aid
  them, from gargoyles and the stone giants called jolanti, to even more exotic constructs like the Alchemical Transformer and the Cannon Cult.</p>
