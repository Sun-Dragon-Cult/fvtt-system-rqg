  <h2>Clan: Ernaldori</h2>
  <p>The Ernaldori are the original royal clan of the Colymar tribe.
  Their lands are near Clearwine Fort; as a result they are often
  called the Clearwine Clan. They are a large clan, numbering
  about 1,600 people. Ernalda is the patron deity of the clan,
  and her priestess speaks for the goddess with the entire tribe.
  Baranthos the Old has been clan chieftain since 1602 and is
  responsible for war and dealing with outsiders.</p>
