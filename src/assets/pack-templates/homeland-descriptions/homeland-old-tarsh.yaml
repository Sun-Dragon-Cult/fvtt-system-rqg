  <h2>Homeland: Old Tarsh</h2>
  <p>Old Tarsh is a group of tribes centered on the foothills of Mount Kero Fin that refuse to acknowledge the Lunar dynasty of Tarsh, remaining loyal to the Shaker Priestess. Once the core of the Kingdom of Tarsh, the tribes of Old Tarsh have been marginalized, and survive by hunting and raiding. Old Tarshites are poor, but proud and fierce. They view themselves as the rightful rulers of Tarsh and see Lunar Tarshites as temporary usurpers. They are notorious for being both vengeful and indulgent.</p>
