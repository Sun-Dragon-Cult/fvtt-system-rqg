  Denotes the ancient wheel. As usual, there are claims for it to be the First Rune, for there would have
  been no growth from Chaos without it. Folktales speak of the World Bird which escaped from the
  Maws of Chaos upon this wheel.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Movement Rune is to be changeable, energetic, rebellious, and ambitious. Such adventurers
  can adapt quickly to changing circumstances, but are also impulsive and reckless.</p>

  Said to represent the Divine Harp with which Order was separated from Chaos. It is quite ancient and
  revered throughout Glorantha.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Harmony Rune is to put the welfare of one’s selfdefined
  community (which might be as small as a village or as large as their entire world) above
  one’s own. Those aligned with this Rune are helpful, careful,
  compromising, generous, and compassionate—they make peace, not discord.</p>

  Symbolizes the Ancient Cup from which the whole world was poured at the dawn of creation. This is
  the symbol of growth and life.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Fertility Rune is to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh, most notably sexual desire. Such adventurers
  are generous and giving, often without personal commitment between the persons involved.</p>

  A Rune of the ancient, all-seeing Sky gods. Said to represent the torch that mortals used to escape from
  Chaos in the Great Darkness and to survive until the Dawn. Yet another candidate for First Rune, for its
  constancy and order set creation apart from random, unsettled Chaos.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Truth Rune is to view the truth as something objective, and outside of individual
  biases, interpretations, feelings, and imaginings. Such adventurers describe things as they truly are, both in matters
  small and large, no matter what the consequences.</p>

  This Rune is closely connected with the art of alchemy, and the dwarves. They claim that this is the First
  Rune, for it provided the foundation from which all else was created.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Stasis Rune is to be resolute and unchanging. Such an adventurer may be
  described kindly as determined or dogged, and less kindly as doctrinaire or obstinate.</p>

  The Puppeteer Troupe, the major cult of the Father of Illusion, always claimed that this was the First
  Rune, for without Illusion, there would be none of us to think we ever were. They refuse to explain
  further.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Illusion Rune is to distort truths or fabricate untruths, for one’s own ends or on behalf of
  others, or in some cases simply for the sake of doing so. Such adventurers view reality as something subjective, and subject
  to their imagination.</p>

  Known to be the First Sword, the immortal and cursed weapon which the god Humakt used to bring
  Death to the world. Others claim this to be the first of the Runes, citing the separation of the world
  from Chaos as the first action in creation.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Death Rune is to separate oneself from the material world and seek to deny or even destroy the
  world of the senses. Such adventurers are relentless, ruthless, and ascetic, willing to deny others and themselves.</p>

  Directly derived from Chaos. Anarchistic cults claim that this was the first step of creation from Chaos,
  therefore Disorder is the First Born of the Powers and the foundation of the universe.</p>
  <p>To be strong with the Disorder Rune is to place one’s own welfare, advantage, or pleasure above all others. Such
  adventurers may be described as individualistic, impulsive, and contrary, or as greedy, thoughtless, and egocentric.</p>
