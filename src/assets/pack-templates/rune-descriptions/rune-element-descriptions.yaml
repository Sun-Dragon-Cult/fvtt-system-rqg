  The most ancient Rune, the First Born, from whom all other Elements were born or descended.

  The Sky is different from the Air, for Air separates the Sky and the Earth. After his defeat by his son, the
  Sky has been aloof from mankind, although vestiges of his worship, such as the Sun Dome Temple, are
  still present in the land.</p>
  <p>The element of Fire/Sky is purification. It
  destroys polluting matter and withdraws
  upward from the Material World. It is the
  Sky Dome and the stars, with its greatest
  manifestation being the fiery Sun that brings
  light and warmth to the world.</p>

  <p><img style="float: right; margin-left:1rem; border:none;" src="systems/rqg/assets/images/runes/moon_full.svg" height="175">
  Moon is the Sixth Element, little accepted amongst her peers. Outside the Lunar Empire she has hardly
  any presence at all, though the Moon is sometimes considered a Condition Rune.</p>
  <p>The element of Moon was destroyed in the
  Gods War but was reborn within Time as
  the Red Goddess. Her secrets are woven into
  balance and time, resulting in the Lunar
  cycles laid upon the surface of this world. The
  Moon accepts Chaos as part of the Cosmic Balance, and
  thereby earns the enmity of much of the rest of the world.</p>
  <p><b>Characteristic:</b> POW</p>
  <p><b>Personality:</b> To have a strong affinity with the Moon Rune is to seek spiritual liberation from the bondage of fear and ignorance, and to be mystical and magical.</p>
  <p><b>Sense:</b> None</p>
  <p><b>Skill Category:</b> Magic</p>
  <p><b>Weapons:</b> Curved blades such as the sickle-sword and the kopis</p>
