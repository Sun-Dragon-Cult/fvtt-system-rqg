# RuneQuest Glorantha (Unofficial) system for Foundry Virtual Table Top

## Usage

Most things are items and needs to be added to an actor. There are a couple of compendiums supplied
with the system like runes and skills to make it easier to build a character. There is only one actor type 
since that can handle everything from humans to spirits & dinosaurs.

## Development

Written in typescript wih the help of the fantastic [League of Foundry Developers Foundry VTT Types](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types)
After a `yarn install` to get the dependencies, do `yarn build` that will build the system into a `dist` folder. For easy development make a softlink from `foundrydata/Data/systems/rqg` to that `dist` folder.
If you want to have hotload on save you can do `yarn build:watch`. 

If you like to remove the system from foundry then remove the file system softlink.

## Project Status

Still very much work in progress. ðŸš§ But closing in on a release version...
