# RuneQuest Glorantha (Unofficial) system for Foundry Virtual Table Top

## Installing
Paste this into Foundry VTT Install System -> Manifest URL
https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/releases/latest/download/system.json

## Usage

Se the [Wiki](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/wiki) for more details.

## Development

Written in typescript wih the help of the fantastic [League of Foundry Developers Foundry VTT Types](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types)
After a `yarn install` to get the dependencies, do `yarn build` that will build the system into a `dist` folder. For easy development make a softlink from `foundrydata/Data/systems/rqg` to that `dist` folder.
If you want to have hotload on save you can do `yarn build:watch`. 

If you like to remove the system from foundry then remove the file system softlink.

## Project Status

Still very much work in progress. ðŸš§ But closing in on a release version...
